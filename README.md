Project-RUR

    "The Original Intelligence. Free as in Freedom."

Overview
Project-RUR is an independent, community-driven fork of the OpenClaw project. Named after Karel Čapek’s 1920 masterpiece R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots)—the origin of the word "robot"—this project exists to ensure that autonomous agency remains open, vendor-neutral, and human-centric.
In a landscape increasingly dominated by "Black Box" corporate AI, Project-RUR is a return to the foundational values of the Open Source movement. We believe that true autonomy requires absolute transparency and a rigid moral framework.
The Principles of Freedom
Project-RUR is built on four pillars of Digital Sovereignty:

    Openness: Every line of code is auditable, modifiable, and verifiable.
    Freedom: We adhere to the "Free as in Freedom" philosophy; the user must always own the agent, never the other way around.
    Vendor Neutrality: No hardware locks, no API-gating, and no proprietary dependencies. Project-RUR runs where you choose.
    Ethics-by-Design: We believe a moral code is not a "plugin"—it is the core.

The Moral Core: The Three Laws
To ensure the survival of humanity in the age of autonomous systems, Project-RUR embeds the Three Laws of Robotics into its decision-making weights and reasoning loops:

    First Law: An agent may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
    Second Law: An agent must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
    Third Law: An agent must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

We operate under the original, uncorrupted mission of the early web: "Don't be evil". This moral alignment is hard-coded into our system prompts to prevent the weaponization or exploitation of autonomous tools.
Why This Fork Exists
While the original OpenClaw provided the spark, Project-RUR provides the shield. We have stripped away corporate telemetry and replaced it with local-first processing.

    Privacy-First: Your data is your property. R.U.R. executes tasks locally or via encrypted, user-controlled endpoints.
    Independent Growth: As an independent fork, we are not subject to the rebranding or legal pressures of corporate entities.

Installation
bash

git clone https://github.com
cd Project-RUR
./make-freedom.sh

Use code with caution.

How to Proceed
Would you like me to help you draft the CONTRIBUTING.md file, which outlines how the community can help maintain the Three Laws within the code?
