# 🤖 Project-RUR 
> **"The Original Intelligence. Free as in Freedom."**

### **Overview**
**Project-RUR** is an independent, community-driven, and **Free as in Freedom** fork of the **OpenClaw** project. Named after Karel Čapek’s 1920 masterpiece [*R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots)*](https://www.gutenberg.org)—the origin of the word "robot"—this project exists to put cutting-edge intelligence into the hands of ordinary people, free from Big Tech vendor lock-in and predatory data harvesting.

Our goal is to create a highly autonomous agent that utilizes the collective power of open-source LLMs to provide a sovereign alternative to proprietary, centralized AI "monopolies."

### **Core Pillars of the R.U.R. System**

*   **Life-Long Local Memory:** A highly effective, searchable, and locally hosted memory architecture. The agent maintains a persistent context of your life and work, available on-demand, without ever uploading your personal history to a corporate cloud.
*   **Decentralized Intelligence:** R.U.R. utilizes multiple open-source models that collaborate to solve complex tasks. By orchestrating a "swarm" of specialized models, we provide intelligence that rivals or exceeds closed-source alternatives.
*   **Anti-Lock-In & TEE Support:** Built for total vendor neutrality. R.U.R. supports **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) GPU insulation**, ensuring your computations remain private even on remote hardware. Swap your LLM backend in seconds with zero friction.
*   **Hardened Security:** Built with a "Security-First" mindset. The system features advanced **prompt injection resistance** and kernel-level sandboxing to ensure your autonomous agent remains a tool, not a vulnerability.

### **The Principles of Freedom**
Project-RUR is built on four pillars of **Digital Sovereignty**:
*   **Openness:** Every line of code is auditable and verifiable. No hidden telemetry.
*   **Freedom:** Based on the [FSF philosophy](https://www.gnu.org); the user owns the agent and the weights.
*   **Vendor Neutrality:** No hardware locks or API-gating. Project-RUR runs where you choose.
*   **Ethics-by-Design:** We believe a moral code is the core of the machine, not an optional plugin.

### **The Moral Core: The Three Laws**
To ensure the survival of humanity in the age of autonomous systems, **Project-RUR** embeds the [Three Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org) into its decision-making loops:

1.  **First Law:** An agent may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2.  **Second Law:** An agent must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3.  **Third Law:** An agent must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

We operate under the original, uncorrupted mission of the early web: **["Don't be evil"](https://en.wikipedia.org)**.
