# 🤖 Project-RUR 
> **"The Original Intelligence. Free as in Freedom."**

### **Overview**
**Project-RUR** is an independent, community-driven, and **Free as in Freedom** fork of the **OpenClaw** project. Named after Karel Čapek’s 1920 masterpiece [*R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots)*](https://www.gutenberg.org)—the historical origin of the word "robot"—this project exists to ensure that autonomous agency remains **open, vendor-neutral, and human-centric.**

In a landscape increasingly dominated by "Black Box" corporate AI, **Project-RUR** is a return to the foundational values of the Open Source movement. We believe that true autonomy requires absolute transparency and a rigid moral framework.

### **The Principles of Freedom**
Project-RUR is built on four pillars of **Digital Sovereignty**:
*   **Openness:** Every line of code is auditable, modifiable, and verifiable by the community. 
*   **Freedom:** We adhere to the [FSF philosophy](https://www.gnu.org); the user must always own the agent, never the other way around.
*   **Vendor Neutrality:** No hardware locks, no API-gating, and no proprietary dependencies. Project-RUR runs where you choose.
*   **Ethics-by-Design:** We believe a moral code is not an optional plugin—it is the core of the machine.

### **The Moral Core: The Three Laws**
To ensure the survival of humanity in the age of autonomous systems, **Project-RUR** strives to embed the [Three Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org) into its decision-making weights and reasoning loops:

1.  **First Law:** An agent may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2.  **Second Law:** An agent must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3.  **Third Law:** An agent must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

We operate under the original, uncorrupted mission of the early web: **["Don't be evil"](https://en.wikipedia.org)**. This moral alignment is hard-coded into our system prompts and safety layers to prevent the weaponization or exploitation of autonomous tools.
